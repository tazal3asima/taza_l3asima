## What’s This?
Listen up, nerds, gather round. Welcome to the **Bus Ticket Automation Script**, a glorious slap in the face to **Texista’s** joke of a security system.

## Why Use This?
Because you’re tired of looking at blurry letters and pretending to be a robot just to get a bus ticket. This script is like bringing a nuke to a thumb war. No more guessing blurry words like some government test subject. CAPTCHA security? Forget it. You're here for a ticket, not to prove you're human.


## Features
- **Full Attack Mode:** Go grab a snack while this thing handles all the ticket-grabbing nonsense. 🍕
